Reinforcement Learning for imperfect information games using the trick card game Schafkopf as a case study
Reinforcement Learning f√ºr Spiele mit imperfekter Information. Das Stichkartenspiel Schafkopf in der Fallstudie
Abstract:
In recent years reinforcement learning(RL) showed substantial improvement in perfect information games such as Chess or Go compared to traditional heuristic based approaches.
The aim of this study was to explore the capabilities of RL in games that do not feature perfect information.
As a case study we chose the bavarian card game Schafkopf, which is a 4 player trick game that features contract bidding, including solo and team play.
I outlined the implementation for Schafkopf using Python and range of Computer players that use varying strategies for move Selection.
Reinforcement learning was then applied to all game phases such as bidding and consequent move selection.
Computer strength was compared for a bootstrapping approach, using a collection of human games, versus as a zero knowledge approach.
Furthermore a GUI allowed playing the Computer.
