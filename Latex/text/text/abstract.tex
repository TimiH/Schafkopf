\noindent In recent years reinforcement learning(RL) showed substantial improvement in perfect information games such
as Chess or Go compared to traditional heuristic based approaches.\\
The aim of this work was to explore the capabilities of RL in games that do not feature perfect information.
As a case study we chose the bavarian card game Schafkopf, which is a 4 player trick game that features contract
bidding, including solo and team play.
We employed the well established \textbf{Proximal Policy Optimisation} algorithm to train two agents, that use two
different approaches generating training data, to play against our own baselines(Random, Greedy, Heuristic) in a custom
\textbf{multi-agent} environment using \textbf{Python}.
By fixing the contract bidding, we were able to accurately evaluate the playing strength of our agents.
We were able to beat the Random baseline convincingly, while failing to beat the two stronger rule based players.
